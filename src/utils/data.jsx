      "Yes, you can absolutely make the highest quality (RSO or FECO) with our equipment. In fact, it’s one of the easiest products to make. It can be as simple as soaking your plant material in 190 proof or higher, non-denatured ethanol, letting it sit for 30 minutes or so, filtering out the plant material, then running this in our equipment until the ethanol has been evaporated out and you are left with an oil. You would then decarb the oil after, and there’s your (RSO / FECO). You could also decarb the plant material first instead, either way is great! For best results, freeze both your ethanol and plant material, while still separate, for 24 hours before combining them. This will limit the amount of chlorophyll that gets picked up and give you a more potent end product.",
